         Affinity execution contexts are supported by the underlying operating system. The creation of certain contexts, 
         (cgroup and cpusets), is outside the scope of the method and requires manual configuration by administrators and integrators. 

         For the CGROUP directive, the task will be assigned to the group by placing the task's process id 
         into the tasks file under the cgroup's directory.  Proper priviledges are required for the process 
         executing this method.  There is also an assumption the the cgroup partition will be mounted 
         under the /cgroup
