        Returns a list of CosNaming.NameComponent from the incoming string.
        
        The name is a string used to generate NameComponent objects.  The 
        NameComponent object takes 2 optional arguments: id and kind.  The 
        string can have one or more names as follow:
        
            id1.kind1/id2.kind2/id3./.kind4
        
        Where the first two objects have the id and the kind.  The third object
        does not have a kind defined, and the fourth object does not have an 
        id.  Both, the id and the kind, can use a '\' as a escape character to
        include either the '.' or the '/' as part of them.  For instance the 
        following pair is valid:
        
            my\.id.my\/kind ==> ("my.id" "my/kind")
        
        If an error is found while parsing the string, then a ValueError is 
        raised and an empty list is returned.
