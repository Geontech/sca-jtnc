I. Installing Dependencies
----------------------------------------------
The Core Framework requires the following RPMS:
 * gcc 
 * gcc-c++
 * apr, apr-devel
 * apr-util, apr-util-devel
 * expat-devel
 * autoconf
 * automake
 * libtool
 * e2fsprogs-devel
 * zip
 * xsd
 * boost, boost-devel
 * libomniORB4, libomniORB4-devel 
 * omniORB-servers, omniORB-bootscripts

The following are option, but highly recommended
 * apache-log4cxx, apache-log4cxx-devel
 * libomniEvents, libomniEvents-devel
 * omniEvents-server, omniEvents-bootscripts, omniEvents-utils

II. Building and installing the Core Framework
----------------------------------------------

The installation of the Core Framework entails setting up environment variables, creating installation directories, and running the standard Autotools configuration and make commands:

    $ export OSSIEHOME=${HOME}/redhawk
    $ export SDRROOT=${OSSIEHOME}/sdr
    $ mkdir -p $OSSIEHOME
    $ mkdir -p $SDRROOT
    $ ./reconf
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

III. Common install issues.
----------------------------------------------

ERROR: "No package 'liblog4cxx' found"

SOLUTION: Try locating liblog4cxx.la.  If, for example, liblog4cxx.la is found in /usr/local/lib64/, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to  "/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig/":

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig/"

-----------------

ERROR: "/bin/mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/share': Permission denied"

SOLUTION: The installation script is attempting to install to a directory for which you do not have write permissions.  Either update the OSSIEHOME/SDRROOT environment variables in order to install to a different location, or perform "make install" with root permissions.

-----------------

ERROR: "/usr/bin/install: cannot remove `/usr/local/share/aclocal/ossie/*"

SOLUTION: The installation script may be attempting to install over an existing copy of the Core Framework that was installed with root permissions.  Either update the OSSIEHOME/SDRROOT environment variables in order to install to a different location, or perform "make install" with root permissions.
