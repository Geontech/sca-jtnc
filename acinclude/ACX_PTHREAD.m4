dnl 
dnl Description
dnl 
dnl This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads. It
dnl sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker
dnl flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler
dnl flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
dnl flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)
dnl 
dnl Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
dnl multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise). (This is
dnl necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
dnl 
dnl NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
dnl but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with $PTHREAD_CC
dnl $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS
dnl 
dnl If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these
dnl variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
dnl 
dnl        LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
dnl        CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
dnl        CC="$PTHREAD_CC"
dnl 
dnl In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
dnl has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
dnl (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
dnl 
dnl ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library
dnl is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
dnl is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
dnl will define HAVE_PTHREAD.
dnl 
dnl Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if
dnl you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work
dnl by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (www.fftw.org) (with help from M.
dnl Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by AFC to the
dnl autoconf macro repository. We are also grateful for the helpful feedback
dnl of numerous users.

# -Kthread: Sequent (threads in libc, but -Kthread needed for pthread.h)
# -kthread: FreeBSD kernel threads (preferred to -pthread since SMP-able)
# lthread: LinuxThreads port on FreeBSD (also preferred to -pthread)
# -pthread: Linux/gcc (kernel threads), BSD/gcc (userland threads)
# -pthreads: Solaris/gcc
# -mthreads: Mingw32/gcc, Lynx/gcc
# -mt: Sun Workshop C (may only link SunOS threads [-lthread], but it
#      doesn't hurt to check since this sometimes defines pthreads too;
#      also defines -D_REENTRANT)
